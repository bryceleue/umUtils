# umUtils
A javascript toolbox for quickly deploying projects with bootscore


### What you need to know first
If you are unfamiliar with [bootScore](https://bootscore.me/), you should check it out first!  It is a slick theme starter kit for WordPress that lets you use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).  umUtils is meant to be used with these other tools, so if you are here first, you should probably take a peek at those things first!  umUtils also makes use of [breakpoints-js](https://github.com/thecreation/breakpoints-js), an awesome plain js library for attaching callbacks to breakpoints.

## What is umUtils?
Basically, it is a collection of shortcuts that I thought would be useful for rolling out projects with the above tools.

**What umUtils can do right now**
* Normalize the heights of a group of (non flexbox) items
* Dynamically store the height of bootScore's header
* Provide events that fire when the window is resizing and when it has stopped
* A wrapper for addEventListener that allows use of anonymous functions and removeEventListener
* Conveniently target scrollSpy elements
* Trigger the click event on multiple elements with one click
* Use a Bootstrap button group with a Bootstrap carousel more easily

## Usage examples
Coming soon!

### Breakpoints
As mentioned above, umUtils uses [breakpoints-js](https://github.com/thecreation/breakpoints-js).  The default breakpoints in breakpoints-js have been modified to be consistent with [Bootstrap 5's breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/breakpoints/)
